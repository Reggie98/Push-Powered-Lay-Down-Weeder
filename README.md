# Push-Powered-Lay-Down-Weeder
A push-powered lay-down weeder for Cambridge Cropshare

## The need
To remove weeds around crops, currently one can hoe or pull by hand. However, the weeds often grow too close to the plants, so need to be removed by hand. Bending over for a whole day can strain the back, and kneeling down can be sore on the knees. The tractor-pulled laydown weeder often can't go slow enough. 

## The design
A simple bogey using lawn-mower wheels with a raised table structure to support the body.

## Status
