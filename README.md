## The need
To remove weeds around crops, currently one can hoe or pull by hand. However, the weeds often grow too close to the plants, so need to be removed by hand. Bending over for a whole day can strain the back, and kneeling down can be sore on the knees. The tractor-pulled laydown weeder often can't go slow enough. 

## The design
A simple bogey using lawnmower wheels, with a raised table structure to support two people, and a memory foam topping to make it comfortable. You lie face down with your arms through the gap at the front and your head on the foam covered head rest. You can then reach to the weeds and plants on one side of a standard bed. To move it forward, both operators push the tops of the tyres.

## Status
Preliminary design stage - need to test that it is feasible to push by hand using the front wheels.

## To do
Add cross bracing if needed; make rear post holes fit the bogey; optional cupboard on one side; head rest not fixed; exploded view; dimensions (for construction purposes); safety aspects
